## The Flashcard App

## Final 4

### App Description
Finally, I have added animations to the app. Now, a animation is 
displayed when switching to the page where you add a new flashcard. 
Also when you press the question page to reveal the answer an animation
is also shown. Lastly, when switching from flashcard to another, there
is also an animation shown.

## Update 2

### App Description
We added a new button that takes the user to a new screen. In 
this new screen they can now input their own question and answer
or decide to exit without doing anything. When they decide to save
their inputs they press the lower left button which will transfer 
them back to the orginal screen but this time the question and answer
they inputed will show.
