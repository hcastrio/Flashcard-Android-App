## The Flashcard App

## Lab 2

### App Description
We added a new button that takes the user to a new screen. In 
this new screen they can now input their own question and answer
or decide to exit without doing anything. When they decide to save
their inputs they press the lower left button which will transfer 
them back to the orginal screen but this time the question and answer
they inputed will show.
